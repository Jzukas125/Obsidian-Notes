#Personal
1. Learn JavaScript, PHP, HTML before internship
2. Get security+ certified - Needs this for a job in cyber security, hopefully done before I graduate or before Fall 2024 is over
3. Finish SOC level 1 on Tryhackme - Helps learn tools for a SOC analyst job that will allow me to get a job in a said field, less impressive than security+ but helpful nonetheless 
4. Bug Hunting for experience in the cyber sec field
