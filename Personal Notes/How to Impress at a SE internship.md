From what Aidan says a good way to impress everyone would be as follows:
	- Have good reports
	- Be collaborative meaning you should get to know your team 
	- Be curious about how the software is structed and evolved over time
	- Coming to work on time
	- Having a clear agenda for meetings
	- Be willing to stay longer if needed to help with extra work.
	- Make sure to revise code
	- Don't stress out too much about wanting to impress

<h3> Have good reports </h3>
	Having good reports is important solely because a manager will be reading them and judging your work off of how will its written or what you've done. Even if you haven't done anything but you have been researching it is important to state that you have been making an effort to solve problems.

<h3>  Be collaborative </h3> 
	Being collaborative is important because it lets people know who you are. It may seem obvious but people are prone to bias and more likely to favor you for better positions if they know you more as they would rather work with someone they know.

<h3>  Be curious about the software </h3> 
	It's important to know about the codebase you will be working with and just showing an interest will seem more impressive than others who are just working to get by. 

<h3> Coming to work on time </h3> 
	Needless to say being punctual is important because you come off as disciplined, polished, and organized. It is also considered professional to be consistently punctual.

<h3> Having a clear agenda for meetings </h3> 
	A meeting agenda will help you and your colleagues prepare for a meeting and guide yourselves through any topic that needs to be discussed while also allowing you to write down any questions you may need to ask. It also shows that you are not only listening but interacting with the meeting, with this being impressive because people often love to be listened to and they will see you as someone that loves listening to them. 
 
<h3> Be willing to stay longer to help with extra work</h3> 
	Doing this shows that your are committed and dedicated to your work while also showing that you have extra responsibility and reliability. 

<h3> Make sure to revise code </h3> 
	This ensures that your work is up to standards and will work properly. Always make sure to comment on your code to ensure it is readable and maintainable. Always revising code also allows good code study habits to be set up to enable continuous improvement while preventing unstable code from being used. 

<h3> Don't stress out too much about wanting to impress </h3> 
	Don't try to hard if they don't like you then doing these isn't going to change much, just allow yourself to do good work and be friends with others. <br>

 Allow yourself time to focus (and a few energy drinks) and you'll be able to work hard. 
 I'm sure there are many other things to do to impress future full-time employers but this is what has been told to me by several managers and recruiters.  
 Another helpful resource is this employer advice guide from several companies, although it may not be specifically SE I still think all managers have the same general thought process.
