From what Aidan says a good way to impress everyone would be as follows:
	- Have good reports
	- Be collaborative meaning you should get to know your team 
	- Be curious about how the software is structed and evolved over time
	- Coming to work on time
	- Having a clear agenda for meetings
	- Be willing to stay longer if needed to help with extra work.
	- Make sure to revise code
	- Don't stress out too much about wanting to impress

Have good reports
	Having good reports is important solely because a manager will be reading them and judging your work off of how will its written or what you've done. Even if you haven't done anything but you have been researching it is important to state that you have been making an effort to solve problems.

Be collaborative
	Being collaborative is important because it lets people know who you are. It may seem obvious but people are prone to bias and more likely to favor you for better positions if they know you more as they would rather work with someone they know.

Be curious about the software
	It's important to know about the codebase you will be working with and just showing an interest will seem more impressive than others who are just working to get by. 

Coming to work on time
	Needless to say being punctual is important because you come off as disciplined, polished, and organized. It is also considered professional to be consistently punctual.

Having a clear agenda for meetings
	A meeting agenda will help you and your colleagues prepare for a meeting and guide yourselves through any topic that needs to be discussed while also allowing you to write down any questions you may need to ask. It also shows that you are not only listening but interacting with the meeting, with this being impressive because people often love to be listened to and they will see you as someone that loves listening to them. 

Be willing to stay longer to help with extra work
	Doing this shows that your are committed and dedicated to your work while also showing that you have extra responsibility and reliability. 

Make sure to revise code
	This ensures that your work is up to standards
