From what Aidan says a good way to impress everyone would be as follows:
	- Have good reports
	- Be collaborative meaning you should get to know your team 
	- Be curious about how the software is structed and evolved over time
	- Coming to work on time
	- Having a clear agenda for meetings
	- Be willing to stay longer if needed to help with extra work.
	- Make sure to revise code
	- Don't stress out too m
