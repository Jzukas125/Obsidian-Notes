Talking about the car he spends too much on

```
- Angelo hacked into cams and had meeting to teach others how to do it and is considered a **federal** crime
- **Club is on freeze for now** but it is not going to be ended
- Bobby needs a list of everyone who attended the meeting and needs to have a meeting with them
- Still deciding what they're going to do
- Head of IT is not opposed to opening the door to getting "hacked"
- Next time this happens and we put in a tickey **Go to bobby**
- Everything is doucmented, all parties are aware
- They have audio recordings
- Have to schedule everythin as an individual instead of as a club in order to compete in CCDC
- Have an extra agreement that shields the club from bad actors and do a better job at the start of the club to inform people to never do illegal activity
- Create a mandotary meeting, make people sign things to stop bad actors from harming the clubs reputation
- Ballpark estimate of club freeze is a couple of weeks
- Should set up a meeting early next week
- ** We should come to the next meeting with a policy **
- Talked about wanting to integrate with the school and we need to write about we want to maybe make it happen (hopefully)
- Next Wednesday at 3:00 is our next meeting
