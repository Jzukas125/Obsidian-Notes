Physical Layers 
These include guided transmission media, wireless transmission, spectrum for transmission, and converting from waveform to bits.

Persistent Storage consists of magnetic or solid state storage. Common ways to transport data include writing to persistent storage, physically transporting the tape or disks to the destination machine, and reading the data aback again.

	Coaxial Cable
	A coaxial cable consists of a stiff copper wire as the core, surronded by an insulating material. The insulator is encased by a cylindrical conductor, often as a closely woven braided mesh. The outer conductor is covered in a protective plastic sheath.

Fiber Optics allow for essentially infinite bandwidth

Bandwidth is a physical medium-refer to the frequency that can be transmitted on the physical medium without having too much distortion.

Maximum Data Rate of a Channel is the relation between data rate and bandwidth that can be defined as follows:
Nyquist's theorem which is a lowpass filter of bandwidth B, then the necessary and sufficient sampling frequency is 2B. It is a noiseless channel if the signal consists of V discrete levels. 

If the channels are usually noisy 

Shannon's formula for capacity of a noisy channel which has a maximum data rate of = Blogbase2(1 + S/N)bits/sec and a signal to noise ration of S/N which is expressed in decibels (dB) = 10 logbase10 (S/N).

Clock Recovery - main issue of a clock recovery is that if the sender sends a long sequence of the same bits it is difficult for the receiver to distinguish them

Cellular Networks - Different generations symbolled by a number and a G. The first three G's provided analog voice, digital voice, and both digital voice and data (internet, email, etc) respectively.

4G tech adds more such as physical layer transmission techniques and is based on packet switching only. 5G adds more on top of 4G by supporting up to 20 Gbps transmissions and denser deployments, and focusing on reducing network latency.
