## The Abstraction: The Process
- CPU virtualizing can provide many illusions of a CPU
- Time Sharing: running one process, then stopping it and running another, comes at performance cost
- A process is a running program

### Process Creation
- A process is created by loading a program into memory
- The processes run-time stack is allocated
- The heap is created
- The OS does some other initialization tasks
- The program is then started at the entry point, namely main()

#### Process States
- Running - currently running process
- Ready - ready to run but the OS has chosen not to
- Blocked - a process has performed some kind of operation, when a process initiates an I/O request to a disk, it becomes blocked and thus some other processes can use the processor

#### Process and Data Structures

- Key Structures that track various relevant pieces of information
- Process list - Ready Processes, Blocked Processes, and Current Running process
- Register context
- PCB (Process Control Block) - C-structure that contains information about each process
- Process control block

- Process state - running, waiting, etc
- Program counter - location of instruction to next execute
- CPU registers – contents of all process-centric registers  
- CPU scheduling information- priorities, scheduling queue pointers  
-  Memory-management information – memory allocated to the process  
- Accounting information – CPU used, clock time elapsed since start, time limits  
- I/O status information – I/O devices allocated to process, list of open files
