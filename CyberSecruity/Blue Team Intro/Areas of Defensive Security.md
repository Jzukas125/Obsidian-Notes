Security Operations Center monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious activity
	Main interests for an SOC are 
		Vulnerabilities-SOC's prevent these from being exploited
		Policy violations-Stopping Users from violating policy
		Unauthorized Activity-Preventing malicious "users" to access the network
		Network Intrusions- Preventing network intrusions to happen and intrusion could be a user clicking a link
		
Threat Intelligence
	Threats-Actions that can disrupt or adversely affect a system
	Threat Intelligence aims to gather intelligence about threats (no shit)
	Threat intelligence gathers intelligence through data which it collected via network logs and public sources (forums)
	Helps know about your enemy and mitigate their attacks and prepare a response strategy

Digital Forensics
	Much like criminal forensics it investigates cyber crimes (hate that name) by analyzing evidence of an attack and focus on multiple areas such as:
		File system- analyzing a digital forensics image to reveal information
		System memory- Analyzing a forensic image of the system memory (like file system but with a different name)
		System logs- Analyzing log files 
		Network logs- Analyzing the logs of the network packets 

Incident Response 
	Incident is a data breach or a cyber attack, can be minor
	Aim is to reduce damage and recover ASAP
		4 Major Phases for responding to an attack
			Preparation: Requires a team ready to handle incidents
			Detection and Analysis: The team has the resources the detect the incident and maybe to analyze it further and learn more about its severity.
			Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: This is when the incident is halted from affecting anything else, eliminated, and any affected system is recovered.
			Post-Incident Activity: After successfully containing the incident this is when a report is produced and hopefully a lesson is learned to prevent future incidents.

Malware Analysis
	Malware types include:
		Virus-attaches itself to code, and works by altering files with the results ranging from making the computer  to slow to making it unusable.
		Trojan Horse- Much like the actual trojan horse it shows a desirable program that hides a malicious program within it.
		Ransomware-Malicious program that encrypts user's files, makes files unreadable until the attacker is paid a "ransom"
	Basically just reversing 

Task 3
	You are a part of a SOC and are tasked of looking into some unusual employee behaviour. You can do this by using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. An SIEM gathers security related info from various sources and presents them via one system. 
	The flag was captured by finding the malicious IP address and copying and pasting it to block it.
	Flag:THM{THREAT-BLOCKED}
