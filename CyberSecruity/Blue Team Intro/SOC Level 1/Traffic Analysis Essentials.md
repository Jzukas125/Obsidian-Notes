# Introduction

Network Security is a set of operations for protecting data, applications, devices, and systems connected to the network. It focuses on the system design, operation, and management of the architecture/infrastructure to provide network accessibility, integrity, continuity, and reliability. This is important to know because traffic analysis is a subdomain of the network security domain, and its primary focus is investigating the network data to identify problems and anomalies.
