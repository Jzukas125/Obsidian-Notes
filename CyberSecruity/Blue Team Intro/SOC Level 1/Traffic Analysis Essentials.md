# Introduction

Network Security is a set of operations for protecting data, applications, devices, and systems connected to the network. It focuses on the system design, operation, and management of the architecture/infrastructure to provide network accessibility, integrity, continuity, and reliability. This is important to know because traffic analysis is a subdomain of the network security domain, and its primary focus is investigating the network data to identify problems and anomalies.

# Network Security and Network Data

Base Network Security Control Levels:
	Physical: Physical controls prevent unauthorized physical access to networking devices, cable boards, L components.
	Technical: Data security controls prevent unauthorized access to network data, like installing tunnels and implementing 
	Administrative: Administrative security controls provide consistency in security operations like creating policies, assess levels, and authentication processes 

The main approaches:
	Access Control: Starting point of network security
	Threat Control: Detecting and preventing anomalous/malicious activity

Key elements of Access Controls:
	Firewall Protection - Controls Incoming and outgoing network traffic with predetermined security rules
	NAC (network access controls) - Controls the devices' suitability before access to the network, verifies device specifications
	IAM (identity and access management) - Controls and manages the asset identities and user access to data systems and resources 
	Load Balancing - Controls the resource usage to distribute tasks over a set of resources over the and improve overall data processing flow
	Network Segmentation - Creates and controls encrypted communication between devices 
	VPN - Creates and controls encrypted communication between devices
	Zero trust model - suggests configuring and implementing the access and permissions at a minimum level

Key elements of Threat Control:
	IDS/IPS - Inspects the traffic and creates alerts (IDS) or resets the connection (IPS) when detecting an anomaly 
	DLP (Data Loss Prevention) - Inspects the traffic and blocks the extraction of sensitive data
