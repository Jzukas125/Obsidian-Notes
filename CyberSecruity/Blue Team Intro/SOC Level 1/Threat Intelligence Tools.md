These notes are following the Threat Intelligence Tools room on Tryhackme
This room will cover the concepts of threat intelligence and various open-source tools that will be useful. This room will help understand the basics of threat intelligence and its classifications, using UrlScan.io to scan malicious URLs, using Abuse.ch to track malware and botnet indicators, investigate phishing emails using PhishTool, and use Cisco's Talos intelligence platform for intel gathering.

# Threat Intelligence

Threat intelligence is the analysis of data and information using tools and techniques to generate meaningful patterns on how to mitigate against potential risks associated with existing or emerging threats.

To mitigate against risks we must ask ourselves first:
Whos is attacking us?
What's their motivation?
What are their capabilities?
What artefacts and indicators of compromise should we look out for?
