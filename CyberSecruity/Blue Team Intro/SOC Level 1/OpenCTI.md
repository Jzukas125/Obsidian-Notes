These notes are on the room OpenCTI on TryHackme and it will cover the concepts and usage of OpenCTI, an open-source threat intelligence platform. The room will help us understand the answer to the following questions:
- What is OpenCTI and how is it used?
- How would I navigate through the platform?
- What functionalities will be important during a security threat analysis?
It is suggested that we visit the MITRE ATT&CK Framework TheHive, MISP, and Threat Intelligence Tools rooms before we continue.
