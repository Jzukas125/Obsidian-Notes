I realized that I need to be taking notes about half way into this so good luck

	Zero Trust versus Trust but Verify 
		Trust but verify - alway verify even when we trust an entity and its behaviour with an entity being a user or a system. Not feasible to verify everything and requires automated systems 
		Zero Trust - treats trust as a vulnerability and caters to insider-related threats. Zero trust doesn't grant trust to a device based on its location or ownership. 


	Threat Versus Risk
		3 terms used to avoid confusion
		Vulnerability - vulnerable means susceptible to attack or damage
		Threat - a threat is a potential danger associated with this weakness or vulnerability 
		Risk - risk is concerned with the likelihood of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability and he impact it may cause
		A showroom of glass suffers from vulnerabilities meaning that the threat is that the glass can be broken while the owner should think of the risk. 
		A hospital uses a particular database system to store records and it is vulnerable to attack by exploit code, knowing this you would have to consider the risk it causes to the business.
