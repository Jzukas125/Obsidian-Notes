# Gathering Info
***OpenCTI*** is a wonderful way to gather any information needed but it may not always be available so other tools such as ***MITRE***. ***MISP*** is also a helpful tool for searching but is more situational within an organization.

# What to gather

# Analyzing potential risky URL
Always make sure to be in a sandbox environment 
Use **Urlscan.io** to get a full scan of any URL and **VirusTotal** to see any malware checking

# Bad Actors on emails
**PhishTool**  and ***GoPhish** allows emails to be scanned and analyzed to find any extra information. This is used in tandem with **Cisco Talos Intelligence** which allows for IP lookup on emails. Should also be using ***VirusTotal*** and  ***Cisco Talos*** to check malicious IPs.

# Other Resources

- **Feodo Tracker:**  A resource used to track botnet command and control (C2) infrastructure linked with Emotet, Dridex and TrickBot.
- **SSL Blacklist:**  A resource for collecting and providing a blocklist for malicious SSL certificates and JA3/JA3s fingerprints.
