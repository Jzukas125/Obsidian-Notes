<h3> Intro </h3>
MITRE is a playbook that researches into many areas outside of cybersecurity for the 'safety, stability, and well-being of our nation'. These areas include ai, health informatics, space security, to name a few. 

<h3> Basic Terminology </h3>
APT is advanced persistent threat. This can be considered a team/group, or even country, that engages in long term attacks against organizations and/or countries. The term 'advanced' can be misleading as it will tend to cause us to believe that each APT group all have some super-weapon. 

<h3> ATT&CK Framework </h3>
ATT&CK is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. In 2013, MITRE began to address the need to record and document common TTPs that APT groups used against enterprise Windows networks. This started with an internal project known as FMX. Within this project, selected security professionals were tasked to emulated adversarial TTPs against a network, and data was collected from the attacks on this network. The gathered data helped construct the beginning pieces of what we know today as the ATT&CK framework. 
The att&ck framework has expanded to cover other OS's over the years such as mac and Linux. Across the top of the matrix, there are 14 categories. Each category contains the techniques and adversary could use to perform the tactic. The categories cover the seven-stage cyber attack lifecycle. Under initial access, there are 9 techniques. Some of the techniques have sub-techniques, such as phishing.
The same data can be viewed on the MITRE navigator

<h3> CAR Knowledge Vase </h3>
The official definition of CAR is "The MITRE Cyber Analytics Repository" is a knowledge base of analytics developed by MITRE based on the MITRE ATT&CK adversary model. CAR defines a data model that is leveraged in its pseudocode representations but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools in its analytics. Lets begin our journey by reviewing CAR-2020-09-001: Scheduled Task - File Access.

In this room we explored tools that MITRE provides and how to use them.
