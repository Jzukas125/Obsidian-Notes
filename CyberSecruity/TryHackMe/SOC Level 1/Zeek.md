# Introduction
Zeek is an open-source and commercial network monitoring tool (traffic analyzer). "Many operators use Zeek as a network security monitor (NSM) to support suspicious or malicious activity investigations. Zeek also supports a wide range of traffic analysis tasks beyond the security domain, including performance measurement and troubleshooting." From the Official description 

Pre-requisites: Basic Linux knowledge and network fundamentals. 

# Network Security Monitoring and Zeek

Network security monitoring has been said many time in my notes and I am not retyping that. 

<h3> Zeek vs Snort </h3>
While both are IDS/NIDs, it is good to know the pros and cons of each tool and use them in a specific manner. While there are some overlapping functionalities, they have different purposes for usage.
