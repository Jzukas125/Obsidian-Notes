A properly designed network permits not only internet usage and device communication but also redundancy, optimization, and security. In a well designed network, if a switch goes down, then packets can be redistributed through another route with no loss in uptime. If a web server is compromised, it cannot traverse the network and access important information. A system administrator should be confident that their servers are secure if a random device joins a network and cannot access those systems. 

All of these concepts and scenarios are what separate a functional network from a well-designed network.

Throughout this room, we will break down these scenarios or objectives and understand different concepts we can use to implement them in a network. We will also discuss potential threats a network may face even after proper best practices are established.

<h3> Learning Objectives </h3>
1. Understand the principles of secure network architecture design
2. Learn and implement common network security concepts and protocols
3. Understand a networkâ€™s environment and potential threats
