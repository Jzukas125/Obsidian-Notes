In depth look at Nmap

# Intro
Nmap is an important network reconnaissance tool that is used to map out networks, hence the name. It does so by scanning ports to establish a parameter of running devices, It can fully map out devices using ports because each device creates its own port when its connected to the internet. Ports are necessary for making multiple network requests or having multiple services available. It helps by redirecting traffic to its approximate places.

Network connections are made between two ports, an open port and a randomly selected port on your own device.
