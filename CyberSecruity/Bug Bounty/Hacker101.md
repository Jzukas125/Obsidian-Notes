	Here to break things before anyone else can, so that vulnerabilities can be fixed before actual attackers can get to them and in order to do so we need to understand how attackers operate, what their goals are, and how they think
	Need to understand what an application is doing and why it's doing it
	Attackers will always have an advantage over defenders
