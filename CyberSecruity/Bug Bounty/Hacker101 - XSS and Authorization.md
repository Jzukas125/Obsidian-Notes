# XSS Review

Three types of XSS that is going to be covered today:
	Reflected XSS - Input from a user is directly returned to the browser, permitting injection of arbitrary content 
	Stored XSS - Input from a user is stored on the server and returned later without proper escaping
	DOM XSS - Input from a user is inserted into the page's DOM without proper handling, enabling insertion of arbitrary nodes
