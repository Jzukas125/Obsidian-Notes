Enrique is concerned about backup data being infected by malware. The company backs up key servers to digital storage on a backup server. Which of the following would be most effective in preventing the backup data being infected by malware?
A. Place the backup server on a separate VLAN.
B. Air gap the backup server.
C. Place the backup server on a different network segment.
D. Use a honeynet.

Air gapping refers to the server not being on a network. This means literally that there is "air" between the server and the network. This prevents malware from infecting the backup server. A separate virtual local area network or physical network segment can enhance security but is not as effective as air gapping.

9 D is correct
Which of the following is not an advantage of a serverless architecture?
A. It does not require a system administrator.
B. It can scale as function call frequency increases.
C. It can scale as function call frequency decreases.
D. It is ideal for complex applications.

Serverless architectures do not require a system admin because the provider manages the underlying function as a service (FaaS).

10 B is correct
Which of the following is the most important benefit from implementing SDN?
A. It will stop malware.
B. It provides scalability.
C. It will detect intrusions.
D. It will prevent session hijacking.

SDN (software defined networking) makes the network very scalable, making it very easy to add or remove resources.

Derek has been asked to implement his organizationâ€™s service-oriented architecture as a set of microservices. What does he need to implement?
A. A set of loosely coupled services with specific purposes
B. A set of services that run on very small systems
C. A set of tightly coupled services with custom-designed protocols to ensure continuous
operation
D. A set of services using third-party applications in a connected network enabled with
industry standard protocols

A microservice architecture builds applications as a set of loosely coupled services that provide specific functions using lightweight protocols. It does not define the size of the systems, but it is not a tightly coupled environment. Protocol choice is often open standards-based, but the emphasis is on lightweight protocols. There is not a requirement that services be in-house or third party exclusively. 

12 C is correct
Abigail is responsible for datacenters in a large, multinational company. She has to support multiple datacenters in diverse geographic regions. What would be the most effective way for her to manage these centers consistently across the enterprise?
A. Hire datacenter managers for each center.
B. Implement enterprise-wide SDN.
C. Implement infrastructure as code (IaC).
D. Automate provisioning and deprovisioning.

The correct answer is to implement IaC. Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer datacenters through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. Datacenter managers won't necessarily provide consistent management.
