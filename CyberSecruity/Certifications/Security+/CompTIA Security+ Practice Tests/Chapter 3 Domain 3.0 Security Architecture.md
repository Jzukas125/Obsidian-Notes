Enrique is concerned about backup data being infected by malware. The company backs up key servers to digital storage on a backup server. Which of the following would be most effective in preventing the backup data being infected by malware?
A. Place the backup server on a separate VLAN.
B. Air gap the backup server.
C. Place the backup server on a different network segment.
D. Use a honeynet.

Air gapping refers to the server not being on a network. This means literally that there is "air" between the server and the network. This prevents malware from infecting the backup server. A separate virtual local area network or physical network segment can enhance security but is not as effective as air gapping.

9 D is correct
