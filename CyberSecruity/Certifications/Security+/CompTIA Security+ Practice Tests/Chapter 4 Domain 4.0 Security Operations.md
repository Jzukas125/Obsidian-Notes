1 A is correct
John wants to harden his organization’s routers. If there are no currently known vulnerabilities or issues with the device, which of the following hardening options will provide the biggest benefit?
A. Moving their administrative interfaces to a protected VLAN
B. Disabling unnecessary services
C. Installing the most current patch level for the OS
D. Enabling SNMP-based logging

Moving to a vlan will provide the most significant improvement in security since there are no known issues or vulnerabilities at the moment. If there were, patching or disabling services would quickly move up.

2 B is correct
Jackson is reviewing his organization’s logs and discovers multiple new user accounts created after business hours using administrative credentials. What term describes searching for
potential issues like this?
A. IoC creation
B. Threat hunting
C. Root cause analysis
D. Eradication

Threat hunting is the process of searching for threats, often using IoCs. Root cause analysis looks for the underlying cause of an issue or event, and eradication is the complete removal of a threat or artifacts of malicious activity.

4 C is correct
Greg wants to gain admission to a network which is protected by a network access control
(NAC) system that recognized the hardware address of systems. How can he bypass this
protection?
A. Spoof a legitimate IP address.
B. Conduct a denial-of-service attack against the NAC system.
C. Use MAC cloning to clone a legitimate MAC address.
D. None of the above.

Greg can clone a mac address. Greg can do this by checking for a MAC label on some devices or by capturing traffic on the network if he can physically access it.

5 B is correct
Melissa’s organization has deployed a firewall that uses three interfaces to provide services.
The first interface connects to the Internet, the second to a network where the organization’s
web servers reside, and the third to a secured network where the organization’s workstations
are connected. What type of firewall architecture has Melissa’s organization deployed?
A. An ACL
B. A screened subnet
C. A binary firewall
D. A multihomed, multiroute NGFW

A screened subnet designs use a firewall with three interfaces, one for the internet or an untrusted network, one for a protected but front-facing network, and for one for a shielded or protected network. ACL (access control list) use rules to control access. NGFW can be multihomed but not multirouted.
