The company that Yarif works for uses a third-party IT support company to manage their
cloud-hosted web application infrastructure. How can Yarif best address concerns about
potential threat vectors via the managed service provider (MSP)?
A. Conduct regular vulnerability scans.
B. Use shared incident response exercises to prepare.
C. Ensure appropriate contractual coverage for issues.
D. Require the MSP to have an annual pentest.

Using appropriate contractual terms is usually the best available option for handling third-party vendor risk. The terms can include things like security practices, such as pentesting, incident response exercises, and vulnerability scanning, and can also have sufficient penalties to ensure ongoing compliance from responsible companies.

Helen is concerned about ransomware attacks against workstations that she is responsible for. Which of the following hardening options is best suited to protecting her organization from ransomware?
A. Installing host-based firewalls
B. Installing endpoint protection software
C. Installing a host-based IPS software
D. Removing unnecessary software

Endpoint protection software like an endpoint detection and response (EDR) or extended detection and response (XDR) tool will provide the greatest protection against ransomware. Firewalls and IPS are less likely.

supply chain?
A. Malware preinstalled on hardware
B. Lack of availability of hardware

Ben wants to conduct a credential replay attack. What should he do first to enable
the attack?
A. Create a phishing email.
B. Conduct an on-path attack.
C. Use a brute-force password attack.

to a competitor’s website. When Mike checks, the domain information has been changed,
including the contact and other administrative details for the domain. If the domain had not
expired, what has most likely occurred?
A. DNS hijacking
B. An on-path attack
C. Domain hijacking
D. A zero-day attack

Lucia’s organization has adopted open source software provided by a third-party vendor
as part of their web application. What concern should she express about her software
supply chain?
A. Lack of vendor support
B. Lack of code auditability
C. Lack of control over open source dependencies
D. Lack of updates

Open source software dependencies are a primary challenge when considering open source supply chain concerns. In this case, Lucia is using a 3rd party vendor who can provide supports, open source code is auditable, and updates are likely to occur with a vendor involved.

24 A is correct
Alice wants to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks. Which of the following will
not be helpful for preventing them?
A. Removing all SQL code from submitted HTTP queries
B. Blocking hostnames like 127.0.01 and localhost
C. Blocking sensitive URLs like /admin
D. Applying allow list–based input filters

Server side request forgery attempts typically to get HTTP data passed through and will not include SQL injection. Blocking sensitive hostnames, IP addresses, and URLs are all valid to prevent SSRF, as is the use of allow list-based input filters.

29 B is correct
Frank is a network administrator for a small college. He discovers that several machines
on his network are infected with malware. That malware is sending a flood of packets to a
target external to the network. What best describes this attack?
A. SYN flood
B. DDoS
C. Botnet
D. Backdoor

His machines are a part of a Ddos attack. This scenario describes a generic ddos attack. These machines could be part of a botnet or they may just have a trigger that causes them to launch the attack at a specific time. The real key in this scenario is the DDoS attack.
