# Describe the Factors that can affect costs in Azure 
Azure shifts development costs from the capital expense (CapEX) of building out and maintaining infrastructure and facilities to an operational expense (OpEx) of renting on infrastructure as you need it, whether it's compute, storage, networking, and so on.

OpEx cost can be impacted by many factors:
- Resource Type
- Consumption
- Maintenance
- Geography
- Subscription type
- Azure Marketplace
