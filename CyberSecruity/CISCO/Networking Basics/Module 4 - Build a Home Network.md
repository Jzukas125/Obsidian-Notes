<h3> Typical Home Network Routers </h3>
Mainly two types of ports for SOHO's:
	Ethernet Ports - these ports connect to the internal switch portion of the router
	Internet Port - Connects the router to a different network than the ethernet ports

Many home networks have additionally a radio antenna and a built-in wireless access point, which by default have the wireless devices on the same local network as the devices that are physically plugged into the LAN switch ports.

<h3> LAN Wireless Frequencies </h3>
	Bluetooth is a technology that uses 2.4 GHz band that is limited to low-speed short-range communications, but has the advantage of communication with many devices at the same time. This one-to-many communication has made Bluetooth technology the preferred method for connecting computer peripherals such as wireless mice, keyboards and printers. 

<h3> Wired Network Technologies </h3>
Ethernet uses a suite of protocols that allow network devices to communicate over a wired LAN connection. An Ethernet LAN can connect to devices using many different types of wiring media.
