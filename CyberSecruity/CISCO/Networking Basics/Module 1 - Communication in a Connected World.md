<h3> Local Networks </h3>
Local networks vary in sizes and can range from simple networks consisting of two computers, to hundreds of devices. Networks installed in small offices, or home offices (SOHO) let you share resources such as printers, documents, pictures, and music between a few local users. 

In business, large networks can be used to advertise and sell products, order supplies, and communicate with customers. Communication over a network is more efficient and less expensive than traditional forms of communication, such as mail or phone calls. Networks allow for rapid communication such as email and instant messaging, and provide consolidation and access to information stored on network servers. 

Business and SOHO networks usually provide a shared connection to the Internet. The internet is a network of networks because it is made up of thousands of local networks that are connected to each other. 

<h3> Mobile Devices </h3>
The internet allows mobile devices such as phones to connect. Lets discuss each device:
Smartphone - Able to connect from anywhere, has many functions (GPS, camera, telephone, etc...)
Tablet - Bigger phone, mostly used as a more mobile laptop
Smartwatch - Can connect to a smartphone to provide alerts and messages
Smart Glasses - Uses a HUD with a small touch pad (coming back), utilizes AR tech

# 1.2 Data Transmission 
<h3> The Bit </h3>
Computers use bits such as 0 and 1 with each being a bit. 

<h3> Common methods of transport </h3>
Once the data is converted into bits, it must then be converted into signals that can be sent across a network media to its destination, with media referring to the physical medium on which the signals are transmitted. Examples of media are copper wire, fiber-optic, and electromagnetic waves through the air. A signal consists of electrical or optical patterns that are transmitted from one connected device to another. 
The three common methods of signal transmission used are:
	Electrical signals - Transmission is achieved by representing data as electrical pulses on copper wire 
	Optical Signals - Transmission is achieved by converting the electrical signals into light pulses
	Wireless Signals - Transmission is achieved by using infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air. 


# 1.3 Bandwidth
<h3> Bandwidth </h3>
Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data. Digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is typically measured in the number of bits that can be sent across the media in a second. Common bandwidth measurements are (thousands) Kbps, (millions) Mbps, (billions) Gbps. 

<h3> Throughput </h3>
Throughput, similar to bandwidth, is the measure of the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time. However, due to a number of factors, throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth. Many factors influence throughput including:
	The amount of data being sent and received over the connection
	The types of data being transmitted
	The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination
Latency refers to the amount of time, including delays, for data to travel from one given point to another. Throughput measurements do not take into account the validity or usefulness of the bits being transmitted and received. Many messages received through the network are not destined for specific user applications. An example would be network control messages that regulate traffic and correct errors.
Throughput does not usually match the specified bandwidth. Many factors influence throughput including:

	The latency created by the number of network devices encountered between source and destination
