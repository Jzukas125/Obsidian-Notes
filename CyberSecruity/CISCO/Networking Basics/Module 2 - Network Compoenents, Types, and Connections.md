All computers connected to a network that directly participate are classified as hosts. Hosts can send and receive messages on the network. In modern networks, computer hosts can act as a client, a server, or both. The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays.

Servers are hosts that have software installed which enable them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other hosts on the network. Each service requires separate server software. For example, a host requires web server software in order to provide web service to the network. Every destination that you visit online is provided to you by a server located somewhere on a network that is connected to the internet.

Clients are computer hosts that have software installed that enables the hosts to request and display the information obtained from the server. An example of client software is a web browser, such as Internet Explorer, Safari, etc.

<h3> Peer-to-Peer Networks </h3>
Client and server software usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to run both client and server software at the same time. In small businesses and homes many computers function as the servers and clients on the network. This type of network is called P2P peer-to-peer network.

The simplest P2P network consists of two directly connected computers using either a wired or wireless connection. Both computers are able to use the simple network to exchange services and data, acting as either a client or a server when necessary. 

Multiple PCs can also be connected to create a larger P2P network, but this requires a network device, such as a switch, to interconnect the computers.

The main disadvantage of a P2P environment is that the performance of a host can be slowed down if it is acting as both a client and a server at the same time. The figure lists some of the advantages and disadvantages of peer-to-peer networks. 

In larger businesses, because of the potential for high amounts of network traffic, it is often necessary to have dedicated servers to support the number of service requests.

Advantages of P2P - Easy to set up, less complex, lower cost, can be used for simple tasks

Disadvantages - No centralized administration, not as secure, not scalable, all devices may act as both clients and servers which can slow their performance.

<h3> Peer-to-Peer Applications </h3>
A P2P application allows a device to act as a client and server within the same communication such as someone texting and both phones being the client and server. Some P2P applications use a hybrid system where resource sharing is decentralized, but the indexes that point to resource locations are stored in a centralized directory.

<h3> Multiple Roles </h3>
A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to one or many clients, as shown. A single computer can also run multiple types of server software. A single computer can also run multiple types of server software, such as file access client, web browser email client, web browser file access client, and web browser email client file access client. 

<h3> Network Infrastructure </h3>
The path tat a message takes from its source to destination can be as simple as a single cable connecting one computer to another, or as complex as a network that spans the globe.

Hardware is the physical elements of a network.

<h3> End Devices </h3>
End devices or hosts are devices that for the interface between users and the underlying communication network. These devices include computers, printers, telephones, cameras, and mobile devices. An end device is either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network.

<h3> ISP Services </h3>
An ISP provides internet for any network. An isp cap be your cable provider, a landline telephone service provider, the cellular network that provides your smartphone service, or an independent provider who leases the bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company. 

The primary medium that connects the internet is fiber-optic which is usually installed underground or in the sea (sharks are biting the internet)

<h3> ISP Connections </h3>
The interconnection of ISPs is the backbone of the internet and this forms a complex web of fiber-optic cables with expensive networking switches and routers that direct the flow of information between source and destination hosts.

<h3> Cable and DSL connection </h3>
Cable - typically offered by cable tv service providers, the internet data signal is carried on the same coaxial cable that delivers cable television.

DSL - Digital Subscriber Line provides a high bandwidth, always on, connection to the internet. It requires a special high-speed modem that separates the DSL signal from the telephone line, with the line split into three channels. One channel is used for voice telephone calls. This channel allows an individual to receive phone calls with disconnecting from the internet. A second channel is a faster download channel, used to receive information from the internet. The third channel is used for sending or uploading information. This channel is usually slightly slower than the download channel. The quality and speed of the DSL connection depends mainly on the quality of the phone line and distance from the central office of the phone company, The farther you are from the central office, the slower the connection.
