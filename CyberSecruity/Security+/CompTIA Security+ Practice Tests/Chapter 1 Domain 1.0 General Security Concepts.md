2 B is correct 
Valerie wants to use a certificate to handle multiple subdomains for her website, including
the sales.example.com and support.example.com subdomains. What type of certificate should she use?
A. A self-signed certificate
B. A root of trust certificate
C. A CRL certificate
D. A wildcard certificate

Wildcard certificates are used to handle multiple subdomains with a single certificate. A self-signed certificate will not be recognized by browsers and other services, creating confusion for customers. Root of trust certificates and CRL certificates are not types of certificates.

Log monitoring is an example of what control category?
A. Technical
B. Managerial
C. Operational
D. Physical

Operational controls like log monitoring, change management processes, and vulnerability management are all put in place to support managing and using technology in a secure manner. 

8 D is correct
Rick wants to make offline brute-force attacks against his password file very difficult for
attackers. Which of the following is not a common technique to make passwords harder
to crack?
A. Use of a salt
B. Use of a pepper
C. Use of a purpose-built password hashing algorithm
D. Encrypting password plain text using symmetric encryption

Retaining the actual password is not a best practice, and thus encrypting password plain text is not a common technique to make passwords harder to crack.  Since the application would need the cryptographic key to read the passwords, anybody who had access to that key would decrypt the passwords. Using a salt, a pepper, and a cryptographic hashing
algorithm designed for passwords are all common best practices.

10 B is correct
Sally wants to ensure that her change management process includes a procedure for
what to do if the change fails. What should she create to handle this possibility?
A. An impact analysis
B. A backout plan
C. A regression test
D. A maintenance window

Backout plans document what to do to return to a state prior to the change being made and are designed to be implemented if the change fails. They may involve undoing changes, restoring from backups, or taking other steps and they must contain an appropriate level of detail to ensure that the change can be undone. An impact analysis looks at the potential impact of a change, regression testing ensures that old issues are not introduced in new updates, and maintenance windows are scheduled to allow for downtime or other maintenance activities with appropriate communications, staffing, and other needed elements.
